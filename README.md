# Lightning Web Components
##### This is a repository created by me to release Salesforce Lightning Web Components which would be Open-Source to be used by all Developer.

Navigate through the **force-app/main/default/lwc** directory to find various LWC components created by me. In each folder you would see dedicated screenshots attached for each individual Lightning Web Component
